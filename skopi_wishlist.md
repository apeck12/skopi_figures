This is a brief wish list for coding changes to be made to skopi down the line:
1. Extend the list of atoms recognized -- currently only the classic macromolecular elements are supported.
2. Create a script params.py that generates a json file specifying the experimental configuration.
3. Support particles delivered by a water rather than gas jet.
4. Incorporate cryonet's method for accelerating the prody calculation.
