Considerations for benchmarking:
1. demonstrate that particle size only matters for the initial diffraction volume calculation
2. assess how SPI, SPI aggregate, and FXS/holo experiments scale (no. images) with:
a. parallelization / number of GPUs
b. detector size 
c. certain types of noise, e.g. beam miscentering?
